# Drools Pi4J proof of concept

This is a small experiment i did to get started on drools and Pi4J. The project demonstrates a simple AND gate implemented using drools. There is a real test version intended to be run on a Raspberry Pi and a simulation version which runs on a normal computer and demonstrates the theory of operation.
